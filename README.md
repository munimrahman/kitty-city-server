It's a Online Pet Shop Site! Check it out! - [Kitty City](https://kitty-city-munimrh.web.app/)

## Project Details

This is a MERN Stack project. I tried to make a website for Online Pet Shop, details about this website is given below:
* This website is made with React, Node, Express & Mongodb. I use Firebase for authentication, also use React Router & Bootstrap. Users can sign in & sign up with email and password and can also using their google account.
* For Database I use Mongodb and server side code hosted in HEROKU!
* On This Web site any one can buy pet related products.
* User can't see product details without login.
* This site is mobile responsive.
* This is a practice project.That's why all data are fake. I design this site inspired by a Themeforest wordpress theme [Jinx Pet Shop](https://preview.themeforest.net/item/jinx-pet-shop-veterinary-woocommerce-theme/full_screen_preview/33304591).
